    <!-- A short description of the recipe -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hummus recipe was handed down to me by my Syrian grandmother. I took it and tweaked it just a touch by adding roasted garlic, making it my most-requested recipe. I finally made it for my grandma a few months ago, and she said it was incredible — that was my Oscar moment! Even people who don't like hummus love this recipe. And I'm modest too!</p>
